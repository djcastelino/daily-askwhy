    question: "Why is the sky blue?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Sunlight is actually made of all the rainbow colors mixed together! When sunlight comes through the air, it bounces off tiny particles. Blue light bounces around more than other colors, so when you look up, you see blue everywhere. That's why the sky looks blue during the day!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "On Mars, the sky appears reddish-orange during the day and blue during sunset - the exact opposite of Earth! This happens because Mars' thin atmosphere contains fine dust particles that scatter red light during the day.",

    question: "Why do stars twinkle?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Stars don't actually twinkle - they shine steadily! But when their light travels through Earth's air to reach your eyes, it gets bumped around by moving air. This makes the starlight wiggle and appear to twinkle. Astronauts in space see stars shining steadily without any twinkling!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The Hubble Space Telescope doesn't see twinkling stars because it orbits above Earth's atmosphere! This is one reason space telescopes can take such clear pictures - they avoid all atmospheric distortion.",

    question: "Why is the ocean salty?",
    category: "Earth",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When rain falls on land, it picks up tiny bits of salt from rocks and soil. Rivers carry this salt to the ocean. When ocean water evaporates into the sky, the water leaves but the salt stays behind. Over millions of years, more and more salt has built up in the ocean!",
    answerIntermediate: "",

    question: "Why does ice float?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Ice floats because it's lighter than liquid water! When water freezes, it spreads out and takes up more space, which makes it lighter. Most things get heavier when they freeze, but water is special - it gets lighter! That's why ice cubes float in your drink.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "If ice didn't float, Earth would be completely frozen! Ice would sink to the bottom of oceans and lakes, more ice would form on top and sink, and eventually entire water bodies would freeze solid from the bottom up, making life impossible.",

    question: "Why do leaves change color in fall?",
    category: "Nature",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Leaves are green because of a special part called chlorophyll that helps plants make food. In fall, when days get shorter and colder, trees stop making chlorophyll. When the green fades away, you see other colors (yellow, orange, red) that were hiding underneath all along!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The brightest fall colors happen when days are sunny and nights are cool but not freezing! This combination produces lots of sugar in leaves while slowing its transport out, triggering maximum red color production.",

    question: "Why do we get hiccups?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Hiccups happen when a big muscle under your lungs (called your diaphragm) gets irritated. It suddenly tightens and makes you suck in air quickly. Your throat then snaps shut, making the 'hic' sound! This can happen from eating too fast, drinking fizzy drinks, or getting excited.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The longest case of hiccups on record lasted 68 years! Charles Osborne of Iowa started hiccupping in 1922 and didn't stop until 1990 - hiccupping an estimated 430 million times during his lifetime!",

    question: "Why is space dark if the sun is so bright?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Space is dark because there's no air! On Earth, sunlight bounces off air particles and scatters everywhere, making the whole sky bright. In space, there's nothing for the light to bounce off of, so it travels in straight lines. If you're not looking directly at the sun or a star, you see darkness!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In space, you can see stars even when the sun is out! Astronauts can see both the brilliant sun and stars simultaneously because there's no air to wash out the starlight during the 'day'.",

    answerSimple: "Mosquitoes are attracted to certain smells! They especially like people who breathe out more carbon dioxide, have warm skin, wear dark colors, or have certain bacteria on their skin. About 20% of people are 'mosquito magnets' because of their unique body chemistry. What you eat and even your genes can make you more attractive to mosquitoes!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Only female mosquitoes bite! Males feed exclusively on flower nectar. Females need the protein from blood to develop their eggs - one blood meal can produce 100-200 eggs!",

    question: "Why does metal feel colder than wood even at the same temperature?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Metal feels colder because it's really good at pulling heat away from your hand! When you touch metal, it quickly sucks the heat from your skin, making you feel cold. Wood doesn't pull heat away as fast, so it feels warmer. Both are actually the same temperature, but metal transfers heat much faster!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Diamond feels even colder than metal when you touch it! Diamond conducts heat about 5 times better than copper - making it feel ice-cold even at room temperature.",

    question: "Why do we see lightning before we hear thunder?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Light travels WAY faster than sound! Lightning and thunder happen at the exact same time, but light reaches your eyes almost instantly while sound takes much longer to arrive. You can count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder to figure out how far away the storm is - every 5 seconds equals about 1 mile!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "You can estimate how far away lightning is by counting the seconds between the flash and thunder, then dividing by 5 (for miles) or 3 (for kilometers). If the count is less than 5 seconds, you're in the danger zone and should seek shelter immediately!",

    question: "Why do we have eyebrows?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Eyebrows keep sweat, rain, and dirt out of your eyes! The arch shape acts like a little roof that directs water to the sides of your face instead of into your eyes. Eyebrows also help you show emotions and recognize people. When you're surprised, angry, or confused, your eyebrows move in different ways!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your eyebrows are more important for recognizing faces than your eyes! Studies where eyebrows or eyes were removed from photos showed that missing eyebrows made it harder to identify someone than missing eyes!",

    question: "Why do airplanes leave white trails in the sky?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Those white trails are like artificial clouds! Airplane engines create hot, wet exhaust. When this hot exhaust hits the freezing cold air high in the sky, the water vapor instantly freezes into tiny ice crystals, creating a white cloud trail. It's like seeing your breath on a cold day, but much bigger!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Scientists estimate that these airplane trails may actually contribute to climate warming! The ice crystals trap Earth's heat like a blanket, and this effect might be as significant as all the CO₂ emitted by airplanes combined.",

    question: "Why do our stomachs growl when we're hungry?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Your stomach growls because it's squeezing and moving around, even when empty! Your digestive system is always working, pushing things through with wave-like movements. When your stomach is empty, these squeezes push air and fluids around instead of food, creating the rumbling sounds you hear!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your stomach doesn't actually do most of the 'growling' - most of those sounds come from your small intestine! The intestines are about 20 feet long and make most of the gurgling noises you hear.",

    question: "Why do we get brain freeze from eating ice cream?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Brain freeze happens when something really cold touches the roof of your mouth! The sudden cold makes blood vessels in your mouth quickly shrink and then expand again. This confuses the nerves, and your brain thinks the pain is coming from your forehead instead! Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth to warm it up and stop the freeze.",
    answerIntermediate: "",

    question: "Why do we float better in saltwater than freshwater?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Saltwater is heavier than freshwater because of all the dissolved salt! When water is heavier, it pushes up on your body with more force. Your body stays the same weight, but the saltwater pushes up harder, making you float better. This is why it's super easy to float in the Dead Sea!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In the Dead Sea (the saltiest body of water on Earth), it's actually difficult to swim normally because you float so well! People typically float on their backs reading newspapers - trying to dive underwater is nearly impossible without weights.",

    question: "Why do we get goosebumps?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Goosebumps happen when you're cold or scared! Tiny muscles at the base of each hair on your skin contract (squeeze), making your hairs stand up. In our furry ancestors, this trapped air for warmth or made them look bigger to scare predators. We don't have thick fur anymore, but our body still does this as an automatic reflex!",

    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When food and organic matter rot, bacteria break it down and release gases as waste products. These gases include ammonia, sulfur compounds, and other smelly chemicals. Your nose is very sensitive to these 'rot' smells as a warning system - it's your body's way of saying 'Don't eat this! It's spoiled and could make you sick!' The smell is nature's danger signal.",

    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The worst-smelling substance in the world is a chemical called 'thioacetone'! In 1889, a German city had to be evacuated when a factory accidentally made some - people vomited and fainted from the smell up to half a mile away.

    question: "Why do boats float?",
    category: "Physics",

    answerSimple: "Boats float because of buoyancy! When you put a boat in water, it pushes water out of the way (displaces it). The water pushes back up with a force equal to the weight of water displaced. A boat's hollow shape means it displaces a LOT of water before sinking, creating enough upward push to keep it floating - even though the boat is heavy!",

Light travels at 186,000 miles per second, while sound only travels at about 1 mile per 5 seconds. So the flash reaches your eyes almost instantly, but the sound takes longer to arrive. Count the seconds between flash and boom, divide by 5, and that's how many miles away the lightning struck!",

    answerSimple: "Stars don't actually twinkle - they shine steadily! But their light has to travel through Earth's atmosphere to reach your eyes. Our atmosphere is constantly moving with pockets of hot and cold air that bend (refract) the starlight in different directions. This makes stars appear to flicker and twinkle. In space, where there's no atmosphere, astronauts see stars as steady, non-twinkling points of light!",

    question: "Why do we close our eyes when we sneeze?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Closing your eyes during a sneeze is an automatic reflex - you can't help it! Scientists think it's to protect your eyes from germs and particles being blasted out at 100 mph. Some also believe it's because the same nerve controls both sneezing and eye-closing, so they happen together. The old myth that your eyes will pop out if you sneeze with them open is FALSE - it's impossible!",

    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "A sneeze expels air at speeds up to 100 mph and can spray droplets up to 26 feet away! This is why covering your mouth and nose is so important. Also, you can't sneeze while sleeping - your brain suppresses the sneeze reflex during sleep.",

    question: "Why are flamingos pink?",
    category: "Animals",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Flamingos aren't born pink - they're born gray! They turn pink from eating algae and tiny shrimp that contain carotenoids (the same pigment that makes carrots orange). When flamingos digest their food, these pigments get absorbed and deposited in their feathers, skin, and beaks. The more they eat, the pinker they get! Zoo flamingos need special food with added carotenoids or they'll turn white!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Flamingo parents can produce bright red 'milk' to feed their chicks! This crop milk is so rich in carotenoids that the parents lose their pink color temporarily - they literally turn pale from giving their color to their babies. The chicks drink this nutritious milk until they're old enough to filter-feed themselves!",

    question: "Why does salt preserve food?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Salt preserves food by removing water! Bacteria and mold need water to survive and grow. When you cover food in salt, it pulls water out of both the food AND any bacteria on it through osmosis. Without enough water, bacteria can't survive and multiply. This is how people preserved meat and fish for thousands of years before refrigerators! Salt also makes the environment too harsh for most microbes to live.",

    funFact: "Roman soldiers were sometimes paid in salt - that's where the word 'salary' comes from (from Latin 'salarium')! Salt was so valuable in ancient times that it was called 'white gold.' Wars were fought over salt mines, and salt routes were major trade highways!",

    question: "Why is the Mona Lisa so famous?",
    category: "History",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "The Mona Lisa became super famous for several reasons! Leonardo da Vinci used revolutionary painting techniques that made her seem almost alive - her mysterious smile appears different from different angles. But what made it REALLY famous was when it got stolen from the Louvre Museum in 1911! The theft made worldwide headlines for 2 years until it was recovered. The publicity turned it from a respected painting into the most famous artwork in the world!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The Mona Lisa has her own mailbox at the Louvre! She receives love letters from admirers around the world. The painting is also insured for nearly $1 billion and is protected by bulletproof glass after someone threw acid at it in the 1950s and someone else threw a rock at it in 1956!",
