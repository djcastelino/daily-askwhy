    question: "Why is the sky blue?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Sunlight is actually made of all the rainbow colors mixed together! When sunlight comes through the air, it bounces off tiny particles. Blue light bounces around more than other colors, so when you look up, you see blue everywhere. That's why the sky looks blue during the day!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "On Mars, the sky appears reddish-orange during the day and blue during sunset - the exact opposite of Earth! This happens because Mars' thin atmosphere contains fine dust particles that scatter red light during the day.",

    question: "Why do stars twinkle?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Stars don't actually twinkle - they shine steadily! But when their light travels through Earth's air to reach your eyes, it gets bumped around by moving air. This makes the starlight wiggle and appear to twinkle. Astronauts in space see stars shining steadily without any twinkling!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The Hubble Space Telescope doesn't see twinkling stars because it orbits above Earth's atmosphere! This is one reason space telescopes can take such clear pictures - they avoid all atmospheric distortion.",

    question: "Why is the ocean salty?",
    category: "Earth",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When rain falls on land, it picks up tiny bits of salt from rocks and soil. Rivers carry this salt to the ocean. When ocean water evaporates into the sky, the water leaves but the salt stays behind. Over millions of years, more and more salt has built up in the ocean!",
    answerIntermediate: "",

    question: "Why does ice float?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Ice floats because it's lighter than liquid water! When water freezes, it spreads out and takes up more space, which makes it lighter. Most things get heavier when they freeze, but water is special - it gets lighter! That's why ice cubes float in your drink.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "If ice didn't float, Earth would be completely frozen! Ice would sink to the bottom of oceans and lakes, more ice would form on top and sink, and eventually entire water bodies would freeze solid from the bottom up, making life impossible.",

    question: "Why do leaves change color in fall?",
    category: "Nature",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Leaves are green because of a special part called chlorophyll that helps plants make food. In fall, when days get shorter and colder, trees stop making chlorophyll. When the green fades away, you see other colors (yellow, orange, red) that were hiding underneath all along!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The brightest fall colors happen when days are sunny and nights are cool but not freezing! This combination produces lots of sugar in leaves while slowing its transport out, triggering maximum red color production.",

    question: "Why do we get hiccups?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Hiccups happen when a big muscle under your lungs (called your diaphragm) gets irritated. It suddenly tightens and makes you suck in air quickly. Your throat then snaps shut, making the 'hic' sound! This can happen from eating too fast, drinking fizzy drinks, or getting excited.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The longest case of hiccups on record lasted 68 years! Charles Osborne of Iowa started hiccupping in 1922 and didn't stop until 1990 - hiccupping an estimated 430 million times during his lifetime!",

    question: "Why is space dark if the sun is so bright?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Space is dark because there's no air! On Earth, sunlight bounces off air particles and scatters everywhere, making the whole sky bright. In space, there's nothing for the light to bounce off of, so it travels in straight lines. If you're not looking directly at the sun or a star, you see darkness!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In space, you can see stars even when the sun is out! Astronauts can see both the brilliant sun and stars simultaneously because there's no air to wash out the starlight during the 'day'.",

    answerSimple: "Mosquitoes are attracted to certain smells! They especially like people who breathe out more carbon dioxide, have warm skin, wear dark colors, or have certain bacteria on their skin. About 20% of people are 'mosquito magnets' because of their unique body chemistry. What you eat and even your genes can make you more attractive to mosquitoes!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Only female mosquitoes bite! Males feed exclusively on flower nectar. Females need the protein from blood to develop their eggs - one blood meal can produce 100-200 eggs!",

    question: "Why does metal feel colder than wood even at the same temperature?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Metal feels colder because it's really good at pulling heat away from your hand! When you touch metal, it quickly sucks the heat from your skin, making you feel cold. Wood doesn't pull heat away as fast, so it feels warmer. Both are actually the same temperature, but metal transfers heat much faster!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Diamond feels even colder than metal when you touch it! Diamond conducts heat about 5 times better than copper - making it feel ice-cold even at room temperature.",

    question: "Why do we see lightning before we hear thunder?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Light travels WAY faster than sound! Lightning and thunder happen at the exact same time, but light reaches your eyes almost instantly while sound takes much longer to arrive. You can count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder to figure out how far away the storm is - every 5 seconds equals about 1 mile!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "You can estimate how far away lightning is by counting the seconds between the flash and thunder, then dividing by 5 (for miles) or 3 (for kilometers). If the count is less than 5 seconds, you're in the danger zone and should seek shelter immediately!",

    question: "Why do we have eyebrows?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Eyebrows keep sweat, rain, and dirt out of your eyes! The arch shape acts like a little roof that directs water to the sides of your face instead of into your eyes. Eyebrows also help you show emotions and recognize people. When you're surprised, angry, or confused, your eyebrows move in different ways!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your eyebrows are more important for recognizing faces than your eyes! Studies where eyebrows or eyes were removed from photos showed that missing eyebrows made it harder to identify someone than missing eyes!",

    question: "Why do airplanes leave white trails in the sky?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Those white trails are like artificial clouds! Airplane engines create hot, wet exhaust. When this hot exhaust hits the freezing cold air high in the sky, the water vapor instantly freezes into tiny ice crystals, creating a white cloud trail. It's like seeing your breath on a cold day, but much bigger!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Scientists estimate that these airplane trails may actually contribute to climate warming! The ice crystals trap Earth's heat like a blanket, and this effect might be as significant as all the CO₂ emitted by airplanes combined.",

    question: "Why do our stomachs growl when we're hungry?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Your stomach growls because it's squeezing and moving around, even when empty! Your digestive system is always working, pushing things through with wave-like movements. When your stomach is empty, these squeezes push air and fluids around instead of food, creating the rumbling sounds you hear!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your stomach doesn't actually do most of the 'growling' - most of those sounds come from your small intestine! The intestines are about 20 feet long and make most of the gurgling noises you hear.",

    question: "Why do we get brain freeze from eating ice cream?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Brain freeze happens when something really cold touches the roof of your mouth! The sudden cold makes blood vessels in your mouth quickly shrink and then expand again. This confuses the nerves, and your brain thinks the pain is coming from your forehead instead! Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth to warm it up and stop the freeze.",
    answerIntermediate: "",

    question: "Why do we float better in saltwater than freshwater?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Saltwater is heavier than freshwater because of all the dissolved salt! When water is heavier, it pushes up on your body with more force. Your body stays the same weight, but the saltwater pushes up harder, making you float better. This is why it's super easy to float in the Dead Sea!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In the Dead Sea (the saltiest body of water on Earth), it's actually difficult to swim normally because you float so well! People typically float on their backs reading newspapers - trying to dive underwater is nearly impossible without weights.",

    question: "Why do we get goosebumps?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Goosebumps happen when you're cold or scared! Tiny muscles at the base of each hair on your skin contract (squeeze), making your hairs stand up. In our furry ancestors, this trapped air for warmth or made them look bigger to scare predators. We don't have thick fur anymore, but our body still does this as an automatic reflex!",

This washes away dust, keeps your eyes from drying out, and provides oxygen to your cornea. You blink about 15-20 times per minute without even thinking about it!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "You blink less when you're concentrating! When reading or using a computer, your blink rate drops to about 5-7 times per minute (instead of 15-20). This is why your eyes feel dry after long screen time - you're not blinking enough!",

    question: "Why is grass green?",
    category: "Nature",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Grass is green because of chlorophyll - the special molecule that helps plants turn sunlight into food! Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light from the sun but reflects green light back to your eyes. So grass appears green because that's the color it doesn't use - it bounces the green light back to you!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In fall, when grass and leaves stop producing chlorophyll, you can see their 'true colors' underneath! That's why autumn leaves turn yellow, orange, and red - those colors were there all along, just hidden by the green chlorophyll.",

    question: "Why do bubbles pop?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Bubbles are made of a thin layer of soapy water surrounding air. Water naturally wants to stick together (surface tension), and gravity pulls the water down. As the water drains to the bottom of the bubble, the top gets thinner and thinner. When the soap layer gets too thin or touches something, it breaks and the bubble pops!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In space, bubbles last much longer because there's no gravity to pull the water down! Astronauts have made bubbles that last for hours. Also, you can freeze bubbles on very cold days (below 10°F) - they form beautiful ice crystals!",

    answerSimple: "Chameleons change color mainly to communicate with other chameleons and to control their temperature, not to camouflage! They use bright colors to show emotions - like turning bright to say 'I'm angry' or darker to show submission. They also darken to absorb heat and lighten to reflect heat. They have special cells with different color pigments that expand or contract!",

    question: "Why does pizza taste better the next day?",
    category: "Food",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "When pizza cools overnight, the ingredients have time to mix and blend their flavors together. The starch in the crust crystallizes, making it firmer. The fat in the cheese solidifies evenly, spreading flavor throughout. Your taste buds also perceive flavors differently at different temperatures - some flavors actually taste stronger when cold!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Scientists have found that our taste buds are most sensitive at body temperature (98.6°F). Cold foods taste less sweet and less salty, which is why ice cream makers add extra sugar to compensate for how it will taste when frozen!",

    answerSimple: "Dogs wag their tails to communicate! A wagging tail usually means the dog is excited or happy, but the direction and speed matter too. Wagging to the right often means happy, while wagging to the left can mean nervous. Fast wagging means very excited, slow wagging means uncertain. It's like their emotional language!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Dogs wag their tails more to the right when they see their owner, but more to the left when they see an unfamiliar dog! Scientists discovered that the left and right sides of tail wagging are controlled by different brain hemispheres linked to different emotions.",

    question: "Why is the sunset red?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "At sunset, sunlight has to travel through much more air to reach your eyes (because the sun is low on the horizon). As it travels through all that air, blue light gets scattered away in other directions. Only the red, orange, and yellow light makes it through the thick atmosphere to your eyes. That's why sunsets look red and orange!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The most colorful sunsets happen when there's pollution or dust in the air! Volcanic eruptions can create spectacular red sunsets worldwide for months. After the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, the whole world had unusually colorful sunsets for over a year!",

    question: "Why do we get pins and needles when our foot falls asleep?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "When you sit on your foot or cross your legs for too long, you squeeze the nerves and blood vessels. This cuts off the nerve signals and blood flow to that area. When you move and the pressure is released, blood rushes back in and the nerves 'wake up' all at once, sending confused signals to your brain. That tingling feeling is your nerves recovering!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The medical term for that 'pins and needles' feeling is 'paresthesia'! The sensation usually lasts 1-2 minutes as blood flow returns to normal. Moving or massaging the area helps speed up recovery.",

    answerSimple: "Mirrors don't actually flip left and right - that's a trick of your brain! Mirrors flip front to back. When you face a mirror, your front faces the mirror's front. The mirror shows what's in front of it, which reverses front-to-back. Your brain interprets this as left-right flipping because you imagine yourself turned around. Try it: if you wear a watch on your left wrist, the mirror shows it on the mirror-you's left wrist too!",

When the pressure gets too high (around 135 psi!), the shell explodes and the soft starch inside turns inside-out, creating the fluffy white popcorn. The 'pop' sound is the shell breaking!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Only one type of corn pops - Zea mays everta! Regular corn kernels won't pop because they don't have the right hard shell. Each popcorn kernel can pop up to 40-50 times its original size, and they can fly up to 3 feet in the air when they pop!",

When your feet sweat in socks and shoes, bacteria living on your skin eat the sweat and produce smelly waste products. The smell comes from the bacteria, not the sweat itself. Clean, dry feet don't smell!",
    answerIntermediate: "",

    question: "Why does salt melt ice?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Pure water freezes at 32°F (0°C). When you add salt, it mixes with the water molecules and gets in the way of them forming ice crystals. This lowers the freezing point - salty water needs to be colder (around 15°F) to freeze. So when you put salt on ice, it causes the ice to melt even though the temperature is below 32°F!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "This is why ocean water rarely freezes even in cold regions! The salt in seawater lowers its freezing point to about 28°F (-2°C). This is also why we spread salt on icy roads in winter to melt the ice and improve traction.",

    question: "Why do knuckles crack?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Your joints are filled with a fluid that contains dissolved gases (like tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide). When you crack your knuckles, you pull the bones apart slightly, which lowers the pressure inside the joint. This causes the gases to quickly form a bubble, which makes the 'pop' sound! The bubble then dissolves back into the fluid, which is why you can't crack the same knuckle again right away.",
