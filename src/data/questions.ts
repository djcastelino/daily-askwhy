    question: "Why is the sky blue?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Sunlight is actually made of all the rainbow colors mixed together! When sunlight comes through the air, it bounces off tiny particles. Blue light bounces around more than other colors, so when you look up, you see blue everywhere. That's why the sky looks blue during the day!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "On Mars, the sky appears reddish-orange during the day and blue during sunset - the exact opposite of Earth! This happens because Mars' thin atmosphere contains fine dust particles that scatter red light during the day.",

    question: "Why do stars twinkle?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Stars don't actually twinkle - they shine steadily! But when their light travels through Earth's air to reach your eyes, it gets bumped around by moving air. This makes the starlight wiggle and appear to twinkle. Astronauts in space see stars shining steadily without any twinkling!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The Hubble Space Telescope doesn't see twinkling stars because it orbits above Earth's atmosphere! This is one reason space telescopes can take such clear pictures - they avoid all atmospheric distortion.",

    question: "Why is the ocean salty?",
    category: "Earth",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When rain falls on land, it picks up tiny bits of salt from rocks and soil. Rivers carry this salt to the ocean. When ocean water evaporates into the sky, the water leaves but the salt stays behind. Over millions of years, more and more salt has built up in the ocean!",
    answerIntermediate: "",

    question: "Why does ice float?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Ice floats because it's lighter than liquid water! When water freezes, it spreads out and takes up more space, which makes it lighter. Most things get heavier when they freeze, but water is special - it gets lighter! That's why ice cubes float in your drink.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "If ice didn't float, Earth would be completely frozen! Ice would sink to the bottom of oceans and lakes, more ice would form on top and sink, and eventually entire water bodies would freeze solid from the bottom up, making life impossible.",

    question: "Why do leaves change color in fall?",
    category: "Nature",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Leaves are green because of a special part called chlorophyll that helps plants make food. In fall, when days get shorter and colder, trees stop making chlorophyll. When the green fades away, you see other colors (yellow, orange, red) that were hiding underneath all along!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The brightest fall colors happen when days are sunny and nights are cool but not freezing! This combination produces lots of sugar in leaves while slowing its transport out, triggering maximum red color production.",

    question: "Why do we get hiccups?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Hiccups happen when a big muscle under your lungs (called your diaphragm) gets irritated. It suddenly tightens and makes you suck in air quickly. Your throat then snaps shut, making the 'hic' sound! This can happen from eating too fast, drinking fizzy drinks, or getting excited.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The longest case of hiccups on record lasted 68 years! Charles Osborne of Iowa started hiccupping in 1922 and didn't stop until 1990 - hiccupping an estimated 430 million times during his lifetime!",

    question: "Why is space dark if the sun is so bright?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Space is dark because there's no air! On Earth, sunlight bounces off air particles and scatters everywhere, making the whole sky bright. In space, there's nothing for the light to bounce off of, so it travels in straight lines. If you're not looking directly at the sun or a star, you see darkness!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In space, you can see stars even when the sun is out! Astronauts can see both the brilliant sun and stars simultaneously because there's no air to wash out the starlight during the 'day'.",

    answerSimple: "Mosquitoes are attracted to certain smells! They especially like people who breathe out more carbon dioxide, have warm skin, wear dark colors, or have certain bacteria on their skin. About 20% of people are 'mosquito magnets' because of their unique body chemistry. What you eat and even your genes can make you more attractive to mosquitoes!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Only female mosquitoes bite! Males feed exclusively on flower nectar. Females need the protein from blood to develop their eggs - one blood meal can produce 100-200 eggs!",

    question: "Why does metal feel colder than wood even at the same temperature?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Metal feels colder because it's really good at pulling heat away from your hand! When you touch metal, it quickly sucks the heat from your skin, making you feel cold. Wood doesn't pull heat away as fast, so it feels warmer. Both are actually the same temperature, but metal transfers heat much faster!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Diamond feels even colder than metal when you touch it! Diamond conducts heat about 5 times better than copper - making it feel ice-cold even at room temperature.",

    question: "Why do we see lightning before we hear thunder?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Light travels WAY faster than sound! Lightning and thunder happen at the exact same time, but light reaches your eyes almost instantly while sound takes much longer to arrive. You can count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder to figure out how far away the storm is - every 5 seconds equals about 1 mile!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "You can estimate how far away lightning is by counting the seconds between the flash and thunder, then dividing by 5 (for miles) or 3 (for kilometers). If the count is less than 5 seconds, you're in the danger zone and should seek shelter immediately!",

    question: "Why do we have eyebrows?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Eyebrows keep sweat, rain, and dirt out of your eyes! The arch shape acts like a little roof that directs water to the sides of your face instead of into your eyes. Eyebrows also help you show emotions and recognize people. When you're surprised, angry, or confused, your eyebrows move in different ways!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your eyebrows are more important for recognizing faces than your eyes! Studies where eyebrows or eyes were removed from photos showed that missing eyebrows made it harder to identify someone than missing eyes!",

    question: "Why do airplanes leave white trails in the sky?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Those white trails are like artificial clouds! Airplane engines create hot, wet exhaust. When this hot exhaust hits the freezing cold air high in the sky, the water vapor instantly freezes into tiny ice crystals, creating a white cloud trail. It's like seeing your breath on a cold day, but much bigger!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Scientists estimate that these airplane trails may actually contribute to climate warming! The ice crystals trap Earth's heat like a blanket, and this effect might be as significant as all the CO₂ emitted by airplanes combined.",

    question: "Why do our stomachs growl when we're hungry?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Your stomach growls because it's squeezing and moving around, even when empty! Your digestive system is always working, pushing things through with wave-like movements. When your stomach is empty, these squeezes push air and fluids around instead of food, creating the rumbling sounds you hear!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your stomach doesn't actually do most of the 'growling' - most of those sounds come from your small intestine! The intestines are about 20 feet long and make most of the gurgling noises you hear.",

    question: "Why do we get brain freeze from eating ice cream?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Brain freeze happens when something really cold touches the roof of your mouth! The sudden cold makes blood vessels in your mouth quickly shrink and then expand again. This confuses the nerves, and your brain thinks the pain is coming from your forehead instead! Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth to warm it up and stop the freeze.",
    answerIntermediate: "",

    question: "Why do we float better in saltwater than freshwater?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Saltwater is heavier than freshwater because of all the dissolved salt! When water is heavier, it pushes up on your body with more force. Your body stays the same weight, but the saltwater pushes up harder, making you float better. This is why it's super easy to float in the Dead Sea!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In the Dead Sea (the saltiest body of water on Earth), it's actually difficult to swim normally because you float so well! People typically float on their backs reading newspapers - trying to dive underwater is nearly impossible without weights.",

    question: "Why do we get goosebumps?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Goosebumps happen when you're cold or scared! Tiny muscles at the base of each hair on your skin contract (squeeze), making your hairs stand up. In our furry ancestors, this trapped air for warmth or made them look bigger to scare predators. We don't have thick fur anymore, but our body still does this as an automatic reflex!",

    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When food and organic matter rot, bacteria break it down and release gases as waste products. These gases include ammonia, sulfur compounds, and other smelly chemicals. Your nose is very sensitive to these 'rot' smells as a warning system - it's your body's way of saying 'Don't eat this! It's spoiled and could make you sick!' The smell is nature's danger signal.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The worst-smelling substance in the world is a chemical called 'thioacetone'! In 1889, a German city had to be evacuated when a factory accidentally made some - people vomited and fainted from the smell up to half a mile away. It smells like a combination of rotting cabbage, garlic, and sewage!",

    question: "Why do fireflies glow?",
    category: "Animals",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Fireflies glow to attract mates - it's like their dating app! They have special organs in their abdomen that produce light through a chemical reaction (mixing luciferin and oxygen with an enzyme). Males fly around flashing specific patterns, and females on the ground flash back if they're interested. Different firefly species have different flash patterns - it's their unique love language!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Firefly light is the most efficient light in the world - nearly 100% of the energy becomes light with almost no heat! In comparison, incandescent bulbs waste 90% of their energy as heat. Scientists are studying fireflies to create better, more efficient LED lights!",

    question: "Why do boats float?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Boats float because of buoyancy! When you put a boat in water, it pushes water out of the way (displaces it). The water pushes back up with a force equal to the weight of water displaced. A boat's hollow shape means it displaces a LOT of water before sinking, creating enough upward push to keep it floating - even though the boat is heavy!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Archimedes discovered this principle over 2,000 years ago and reportedly shouted 'Eureka!' (I found it!) and ran naked through the streets of Greece in excitement! This same principle explains why huge metal ships can float while a small metal coin sinks - it's all about shape and displaced water.",

    question: "Why does the wind blow?",
    category: "Earth",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Wind happens because the Sun heats different parts of Earth unevenly! Hot air is lighter and rises up, while cool air is heavier and sinks down. As hot air rises in one place, cooler air rushes in to fill the space - and that moving air is wind! The bigger the temperature difference between two areas, the stronger the wind. Earth's rotation also makes wind curve and swirl!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The fastest wind ever recorded on Earth was 253 mph during Tropical Cyclone Olivia in 1996! But that's nothing compared to Neptune, where winds reach 1,200 mph - five times faster than the worst tornado on Earth!",

    question: "Why do scabs form when we get cut?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When you get cut, your body immediately works to stop the bleeding and protect the wound! Blood cells called platelets rush to the cut and stick together, forming a plug. They release chemicals that create fibrin - sticky threads that weave together into a mesh. This mesh traps blood cells and hardens into a scab. The scab is like a natural bandage that keeps germs out while new skin grows underneath!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your body can form a blood clot in less than 60 seconds after a cut! The entire clotting process involves more than 20 different proteins working together in a precise sequence called the 'coagulation cascade.' Without it, even a small cut could be life-threatening.",

    question: "Why is the ocean blue?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "The ocean is blue because of how water absorbs and reflects light! When sunlight hits the ocean, water absorbs red, orange, and yellow colors but reflects blue back to your eyes. The deeper the water, the bluer it looks because there's more water to absorb the warm colors. In shallow water or over sand, you can see other colors because light bounces off the bottom!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Pure water is actually very slightly blue! Even in a white bathtub, if you filled it deep enough (about 10 meters), you'd notice a blue tint. The common myth that the ocean is blue only because it reflects the sky is false - the ocean would be blue even under a gray sky!",

    question: "Why do magnets stick to some things but not others?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Magnets stick to metals that contain iron, nickel, or cobalt - these are called 'ferromagnetic' materials! Inside these metals, tiny magnetic regions all line up the same way when near a magnet, creating a strong magnetic pull. Other materials like wood, plastic, aluminum, and copper don't have these magnetic properties, so magnets don't stick to them. It's all about how the atoms are arranged!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Magnets can lose their magnetism if you heat them up, drop them repeatedly, or hit them hard! The heat or impact scrambles the aligned magnetic regions. However, you can also CREATE a magnet by stroking a piece of iron with a magnet in the same direction many times!",

    question: "Why do babies have more bones than adults?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Babies are born with about 300 bones, but adults only have 206! This isn't because bones disappear - many baby bones are made of flexible cartilage that later hardens and fuses together. For example, a baby's skull has gaps (soft spots) between bone plates to allow the head to squeeze through the birth canal. As you grow, these separate pieces merge into larger, stronger bones!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The soft spots on a baby's head (fontanelles) don't close until the baby is 12-18 months old! You can actually see the baby's pulse through the soft spot because there's no bone protecting that area yet. Despite how delicate it looks, it's covered by tough membranes that protect the brain.",

    question: "Why does lightning happen before thunder?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Lightning and thunder happen at the SAME time, but you see lightning before you hear thunder because light travels much faster than sound! Light travels at 186,000 miles per second, while sound only travels at about 1 mile per 5 seconds. So the flash reaches your eyes almost instantly, but the sound takes longer to arrive. Count the seconds between flash and boom, divide by 5, and that's how many miles away the lightning struck!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Thunder is caused by lightning heating the air to 50,000°F (hotter than the Sun's surface!) in a fraction of a second! This super-heating makes the air expand so rapidly that it creates a shock wave - the boom you hear. The rumbling continues because sound from different parts of the lightning bolt reaches you at different times.",
