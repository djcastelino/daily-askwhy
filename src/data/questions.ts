    question: "Why is the sky blue?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Sunlight is actually made of all the rainbow colors mixed together! When sunlight comes through the air, it bounces off tiny particles. Blue light bounces around more than other colors, so when you look up, you see blue everywhere. That's why the sky looks blue during the day!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "On Mars, the sky appears reddish-orange during the day and blue during sunset - the exact opposite of Earth! This happens because Mars' thin atmosphere contains fine dust particles that scatter red light during the day.",

    question: "Why do we yawn?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When you're tired or bored, your brain needs a boost! Yawning helps wake you up by making you take a big, deep breath. It stretches your jaw and brings fresh air and blood to your brain. It's like your body's natural 'wake up' button!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Yawning is so contagious that even reading about yawning or seeing the word 'yawn' can make you yawn! Studies show that about 55% of people will yawn within 5 minutes of seeing someone else yawn.",

    question: "Why do cats purr?",
    category: "Animals",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Cats purr when they're happy, like when you pet them! But they also purr when they're hurt or scared. Scientists think the vibrations from purring actually help cats heal faster and feel better. It's like they have their own built-in healing machine!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Scientists have discovered that astronauts could benefit from 'purr therapy!' The vibration frequencies in cat purrs match the mechanical vibrations used to prevent bone density loss in astronauts during long space missions.",

    question: "Why do onions make you cry?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When you cut an onion, it releases a special gas that floats up to your eyes. This gas stings your eyes! Your body makes tears to wash the gas away and protect your eyes. Even though it's annoying, your tears are actually helping you!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Scientists have genetically engineered 'tearless onions' by modifying the enzyme that produces the crying gas! These onions still taste the same but don't make you cry when cutting them.",

    question: "Why do stars twinkle?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Stars don't actually twinkle - they shine steadily! But when their light travels through Earth's air to reach your eyes, it gets bumped around by moving air. This makes the starlight wiggle and appear to twinkle. Astronauts in space see stars shining steadily without any twinkling!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The Hubble Space Telescope doesn't see twinkling stars because it orbits above Earth's atmosphere! This is one reason space telescopes can take such clear pictures - they avoid all atmospheric distortion.",

    question: "Why is the ocean salty?",
    category: "Earth",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "When rain falls on land, it picks up tiny bits of salt from rocks and soil. Rivers carry this salt to the ocean. When ocean water evaporates into the sky, the water leaves but the salt stays behind. Over millions of years, more and more salt has built up in the ocean!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "If you evaporated all the water from all the oceans, the leftover salt would cover all the continents in a layer 500 feet (150 meters) thick - taller than a 40-story building!",

    question: "Why do we have fingerprints?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Fingerprints help you grip things! The tiny ridges on your fingers work like tire treads, making it easier to hold objects without dropping them. They also help you feel textures better. And here's something cool - everyone's fingerprints are completely unique, even identical twins!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Koalas are one of the few animals besides primates to have fingerprints! Their fingerprints are so similar to human fingerprints that they could potentially contaminate a crime scene.",

    question: "Why do we dream?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Scientists think dreams help your brain sort through memories and feelings from the day. While you sleep, your brain is busy deciding what to remember and what to forget. Dreams might also help you practice dealing with new or scary situations in a safe way!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "You can't read text in dreams! The language centers of your brain are less active during sleep, so if you try to read in a dream, the text usually appears blurry or changes when you look away and back again.",

    id: 9,
    question: "Why does ice float?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Ice floats because it's lighter than liquid water! When water freezes, it spreads out and takes up more space, which makes it lighter. Most things get heavier when they freeze, but water is special - it gets lighter! That's why ice cubes float in your drink.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "If ice didn't float, Earth would be completely frozen! Ice would sink to the bottom of oceans and lakes, more ice would form on top and sink, and eventually entire water bodies would freeze solid from the bottom up, making life impossible.",

    question: "Why do leaves change color in fall?",
    category: "Nature",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Leaves are green because of a special part called chlorophyll that helps plants make food. In fall, when days get shorter and colder, trees stop making chlorophyll. When the green fades away, you see other colors (yellow, orange, red) that were hiding underneath all along!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The brightest fall colors happen when days are sunny and nights are cool but not freezing! This combination produces lots of sugar in leaves while slowing its transport out, triggering maximum red color production.",

    question: "Why do we get hiccups?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Hiccups happen when a big muscle under your lungs (called your diaphragm) gets irritated. It suddenly tightens and makes you suck in air quickly. Your throat then snaps shut, making the 'hic' sound! This can happen from eating too fast, drinking fizzy drinks, or getting excited.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The longest case of hiccups on record lasted 68 years! Charles Osborne of Iowa started hiccupping in 1922 and didn't stop until 1990 - hiccupping an estimated 430 million times during his lifetime!",

    question: "Why is space dark if the sun is so bright?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Space is dark because there's no air! On Earth, sunlight bounces off air particles and scatters everywhere, making the whole sky bright. In space, there's nothing for the light to bounce off of, so it travels in straight lines. If you're not looking directly at the sun or a star, you see darkness!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In space, you can see stars even when the sun is out! Astronauts can see both the brilliant sun and stars simultaneously because there's no air to wash out the starlight during the 'day'.",

    question: "Why do mosquitoes bite some people more than others?",
    category: "Animals",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Mosquitoes are attracted to certain smells! They especially like people who breathe out more carbon dioxide, have warm skin, wear dark colors, or have certain bacteria on their skin. About 20% of people are 'mosquito magnets' because of their unique body chemistry. What you eat and even your genes can make you more attractive to mosquitoes!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Only female mosquitoes bite! Males feed exclusively on flower nectar. Females need the protein from blood to develop their eggs - one blood meal can produce 100-200 eggs!",

    question: "Why does metal feel colder than wood even at the same temperature?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Metal feels colder because it's really good at pulling heat away from your hand! When you touch metal, it quickly sucks the heat from your skin, making you feel cold. Wood doesn't pull heat away as fast, so it feels warmer. Both are actually the same temperature, but metal transfers heat much faster!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Diamond feels even colder than metal when you touch it! Diamond conducts heat about 5 times better than copper - making it feel ice-cold even at room temperature.",

    question: "Why do we see lightning before we hear thunder?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Light travels WAY faster than sound! Lightning and thunder happen at the exact same time, but light reaches your eyes almost instantly while sound takes much longer to arrive. You can count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder to figure out how far away the storm is - every 5 seconds equals about 1 mile!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "You can estimate how far away lightning is by counting the seconds between the flash and thunder, then dividing by 5 (for miles) or 3 (for kilometers). If the count is less than 5 seconds, you're in the danger zone and should seek shelter immediately!",

    question: "Why do we have eyebrows?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Eyebrows keep sweat, rain, and dirt out of your eyes! The arch shape acts like a little roof that directs water to the sides of your face instead of into your eyes. Eyebrows also help you show emotions and recognize people. When you're surprised, angry, or confused, your eyebrows move in different ways!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your eyebrows are more important for recognizing faces than your eyes! Studies where eyebrows or eyes were removed from photos showed that missing eyebrows made it harder to identify someone than missing eyes!",

    id: 17,
    question: "Why do airplanes leave white trails in the sky?",
    category: "Science",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Those white trails are like artificial clouds! Airplane engines create hot, wet exhaust. When this hot exhaust hits the freezing cold air high in the sky, the water vapor instantly freezes into tiny ice crystals, creating a white cloud trail. It's like seeing your breath on a cold day, but much bigger!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Scientists estimate that these airplane trails may actually contribute to climate warming! The ice crystals trap Earth's heat like a blanket, and this effect might be as significant as all the CO₂ emitted by airplanes combined.",

    id: 18,
    question: "Why do our stomachs growl when we're hungry?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Your stomach growls because it's squeezing and moving around, even when empty! Your digestive system is always working, pushing things through with wave-like movements. When your stomach is empty, these squeezes push air and fluids around instead of food, creating the rumbling sounds you hear!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Your stomach doesn't actually do most of the 'growling' - most of those sounds come from your small intestine! The intestines are about 20 feet long and make most of the gurgling noises you hear.",

    id: 19,
    question: "Why is yawning contagious?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Yawning is contagious because of special 'mirror neurons' in your brain! When you see someone yawn, these neurons make your brain copy what you saw. This happens automatically - you can't stop it! Scientists think this might have helped early humans stay alert as a group.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Even reading about yawning can make you yawn! Studies show that about 55% of people will yawn within 5 minutes of reading about yawning. (Are you yawning yet?)",

    id: 20,
    question: "Why do hot air balloons float?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Hot air balloons float because hot air is lighter than cold air! When you heat the air inside the balloon, it becomes lighter than the cooler air outside. This lighter hot air rises, lifting the balloon up! To go down, the pilot lets the air cool down.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The first hot air balloon passengers weren't humans - they were a sheep, a duck, and a rooster! In 1783, these animals were sent up first to test if living creatures could survive at high altitude.",

    id: 21,
    question: "Why do we get brain freeze from eating ice cream?",
    category: "Human Body",
    difficulty: "easy",
    answerSimple: "Brain freeze happens when something really cold touches the roof of your mouth! The sudden cold makes blood vessels in your mouth quickly shrink and then expand again. This confuses the nerves, and your brain thinks the pain is coming from your forehead instead! Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth to warm it up and stop the freeze.",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "The scientific name for brain freeze is 'sphenopalatine ganglioneuralgia' - one of the longest medical terms for one of the shortest-lasting pains! It's also completely harmless despite how painful it feels.",

    question: "Why don't spiders get stuck in their own webs?",
    category: "Animals",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Spiders are clever architects! They build their webs with two types of silk: sticky silk (for catching prey) and non-sticky silk (for walking on). The spider carefully walks only on the non-sticky strands. They also have special hairs on their legs that help prevent sticking!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Spider silk is one of the strongest materials in nature - stronger than steel of the same thickness! If you could make a strand of spider silk as thick as a pencil, it could stop a Boeing 747 airplane in flight.",

    id: 23,
    question: "Why do we float better in saltwater than freshwater?",
    category: "Physics",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Saltwater is heavier than freshwater because of all the dissolved salt! When water is heavier, it pushes up on your body with more force. Your body stays the same weight, but the saltwater pushes up harder, making you float better. This is why it's super easy to float in the Dead Sea!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "In the Dead Sea (the saltiest body of water on Earth), it's actually difficult to swim normally because you float so well! People typically float on their backs reading newspapers - trying to dive underwater is nearly impossible without weights.",

    question: "Why do fireflies glow?",
    category: "Animals",
    difficulty: "medium",
    answerSimple: "Fireflies glow to talk to each other, especially to find mates! They have a special chemical reaction in their body that creates light without heat. Males fly around flashing patterns to attract females. Females sitting in grass flash back if they're interested! Each firefly species has its own unique flashing pattern!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "Some female fireflies are 'femme fatales' - they mimic the flash patterns of other species to lure males in, then eat them! These carnivorous females can mimic multiple species' signals.",

    question: "Why does the Moon look bigger when it's near the horizon?",
    category: "Space",
    difficulty: "hard",
    answerSimple: "This is a trick your brain plays on you! The Moon doesn't actually get bigger - it just looks bigger near the horizon. When the Moon is near houses, trees, and mountains, your brain compares it to those objects and thinks the Moon must be huge! High in the sky with nothing to compare, it looks smaller. But it's really the same size!",
    answerIntermediate: "",
    answerAdvanced: "",
    funFact: "You can prove the Moon illusion is in your head by making a small circle with your finger and thumb and looking at the Moon through it when it's on the horizon and again when it's overhead - it will appear the same size both times!",
